rhyme-tags is a web-based rhyme visualization tool.

See the online demo: https://www.attac.us/rhyme-tags.

## Usage

rhyme-tags uses a custom poem markup language.

Here is an excerpt of "Fat Cats, Bigga Fish" by The Coup,
marked up for rhyme-tags:

    It's almost 10 o'clock, see, I got a ball of lint for { property: }
    So I slip my beanie on { sloppily: property }
    And promenade out to take up a { collection: }
    I got game like I read the { directions: collection }
    I'm wishing that I had an auto{ mobile: }
    As I feel the cold wind { rush past: }
    But let me state that I'm a hustler { for real: mobile }
    So you know I got the stolen { bus pass: rush past }
    
Rhyming sections of a poem are enclosed by brackets in a
`{ text: tag }` format.

Rhymes with blank tags, like (as shown above) `{ mobile: }`,
expand, and are treated like `{ mobile: mobile }`.

Each 'tag' should be unique to a rhyme group.
It is not necessary, but it can be helpful to choose a tag
as simply the first rhyme in that group to appear,
as is done above.

## Compiling from source

rhyme-tags is intended to be built on Linux.
If you are using Windows 10, you may want to use the
Windows Subsystem for Linux
([WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about))

and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
are installed on your system.

First, navigate to the project's directory and
install its Javascript dependencies:

    $ cd rhyme-tags/
    $ npm install

rhyme-tags uses [Elm](http://elm-lang.org),
a language that compiles to Javascript.
Install the Elm binaries and the project's Elm dependencies:

    $ npm install -g elm
    $ elm-package install

rhyme-tags compiles to one HTML file.
To build the project into `dist/index.html`, run:

    $ npm run build
